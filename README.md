# EVA

Windows oriented performance, privacy and latency tuning guide.

## Introduction

The custom ISO from the previous project is discontinued so please do not ask for it as it has been recreated with malware. Although I have chosen to keep the old project's name for the new project, nothing is branded such as the resources included in the repository.

I have tried my best to provide technical references, my own research and a valid justification to the information provided to prevent making changes that would otherwise make your system perform worse than stock but simultaneously also provide a solid baseline for experimenting with settings in the future.

The guidance is currently updated and has been tested on Windows 7 through to Windows 10. Configuring Windows 11 currently has major problems. See a full list of [issues](https://github.com/amitxv/EVA/issues).
