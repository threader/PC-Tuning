# Configure the NVIDIA Driver

## Stripping & Installing the Driver

I recommend using the 472.12 ([Windows 7/Windows 8](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/results/180551), [Windows 10+](https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/180555/en-us/)) as it is the latest non-DCH driver. The latest DCH driver now ships with the nvidia control panel, Windows Store is no longer required to install it so feel free to use that on Windows 10+.

- Extract the driver executable package with 7-Zip & remove all folders **except** the following:

    ```
    Display.Driver
    NVI2
    EULA.txt
    ListDevices.txt
    setup.cfg
    setup.exe
    ```
        
- Remove the following lines from ``setup.cfg`` (near the bottom):

    ```
    <file name="${{EulaHtmlFile}}"/>
    <file name="${{FunctionalConsentFile}}"/>
    <file name="${{PrivacyPolicyFile}}"/>
    ```

- In ``NVI2\presentations.cfg`` set the value for ``ProgressPresentationUrl`` & ``ProgressPresentationSelectedPackageUrl`` to an empty string: ``value=""``.

- Run setup.exe to install the driver.

    - If setup fails however you followed the steps above correctly, try redownload the driver & follow the steps again. Some users have reported this is due to a corrupted download.

- Open CMD & enter the commands below to remove & disable telemetry.

    ```bat
    for /f "delims=" %a in ('where /r C:\ *NvTelemetry*') do (if exist "%a" (del /f /q /s "%a"))

    for %a in ("C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\Display.NvContainer\plugins\LocalSystem\DisplayDriverRAS", "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\DisplayDriverRAS", "C:\ProgramData\NVIDIA Corporation\DisplayDriverRAS") do (if exist "%a" (rd /s /q "%a"))

    reg.exe add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\NVIDIA Corporation\NvControlPanel2\Client" /v "OptInOrOutPreference" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f 

    reg.exe add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\nvlddmkm\Global\Startup" /v "SendTelemetryData" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
    ```

## Disable HDCP

HDCP Can be disabled with the [following registry key](https://github.com/djdallmann/GamingPCSetup/blob/master/CONTENT/RESEARCH/WINDRIVERS/README.md#q-are-there-any-configuration-options-that-allow-you-to-disable-hdcp-when-using-nvidia-based-graphics-cards) (reboot required), ensure to change the driver key to suit your needs:

- Run ``C:\prerequisites\scripts\get-driver-keys.bat`` to get the driver keys on your system
        
    ```bat
    reg.exe add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0000" /v "RMHdcpKeyglobZero" /t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f
    ```

## Configure NVIDIA Control Panel

- Enable ``Desktop > Enable Developer Settings``, I also like to disable the notification tray icon

- In the ``3D Settings > Manage 3D settings`` section, configure the following (don't change anything else):

    - **Anisotropic filtering** - Off

    - **Antialiasing - Gamma correction** - Off

    - **Low Latency Mode** - On (limits prerendered frames to 1)

    - **Power management mode** - Prefer maximum performance

    - **Texture filtering - Quality** - High performance

    - [Threaded Optimization offloads GPU-related processing tasks on the CPU](https://tweakguides.pcgamingwiki.com/NVFORCE_8.html), it usually hurts frametime consistency but feel free to test it yourself. You should also consider whether or not you are already CPU bottlenecked if you do choose to enable the setting

- In the ``Developer > Manage GPU Performance Counters``, enable ``Allow access to the GPU performance counters to all users``.

- In the ``Display > Adjust desktop size & position`` section, set the scaling mode to ``No Scaling`` & set perform scaling on to ``Display``. Configure your resolution & refresh rate.

- Consider disabling G-Sync, it has the potential to increase input latency due to extra processing however it has supposedly improved over time so feel free to test it yourself. Your mileage may vary.

## Force P-State 0
    
Force P-State 0 with the [following registry key](https://github.com/djdallmann/GamingPCSetup/blob/master/CONTENT/RESEARCH/WINDRIVERS/README.md#q-is-there-a-registry-setting-that-can-force-your-display-adapter-to-remain-at-its-highest-performance-state-pstate-p0) to reduce render time & jitter caused by frequency transitions (reboot required), ensure to change the driver key to suit your needs:

- Run ``C:\prerequisites\scripts\get-driver-keys.bat`` to get the driver keys on your system

    ```bat
    reg.exe add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\0000" /v "DisableDynamicPstate" /t REG_DWORD /d "1" /f
    ```

## Disable Ansel

- Disable Ansel with ``C:\prerequisites\nvidia-ansel-configurator\NvCameraConfiguration_v1.0.0.6.exe``.

## Configure NVIDIA Inspector

Feel free to skip this step as I have not verified it affects anything as of yet but there should be no harm following along.

- Disable [Cuda P2 States](https://babeltechreviews.com/nvidia-cuda-force-p2-state) & [SILK Smoothness](https://www.avsim.com/forums/topic/552651-nvidia-setting-silk-smoothness) in ``C:\prerequisites\nvidia-profile-inspector\nvidiaProfileInspector.exe``.
